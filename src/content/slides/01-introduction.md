# Opening Provocations

- Is knowledge the same as information?
- Can we truly capture knowledge in documents?
- Is knowledge management even possible?
- What's the difference between knowing and believing?

**Before we talk about managing knowledge, we must ask: what is knowledge?**

## detailed
# What is Knowledge?
## Before we can manage it, we must understand it

We're about to spend hours discussing knowledge management. But first: **what is knowledge?**

This isn't a semantic game. How we answer this question determines whether our KM efforts will succeed or fail.

### The Fundamental Questions

- **Knowledge vs. Information**: Is knowledge just organized data? Or something more?
- **Capture vs. Creation**: Can we truly "capture" knowledge? Or do we only create new knowledge?
- **Individual vs. Social**: Does knowledge exist in minds, or between people?
- **Explicit vs. Tacit**: Can all knowledge be articulated? Or is some fundamentally unspeakable?

### Why This Matters

Most knowledge management systems fail because they treat knowledge like information—something that can be stored, retrieved, and transferred like files on a hard drive.

But if knowledge is something different—something that lives in practice, in relationships, in embodied experience—then we need entirely different approaches.

### The Philosophical Foundation

This is **epistemology**: the study of knowledge itself. And before we can critique KM frameworks or propose alternatives, we need to understand what knowledge actually is.
