# What Organizations Actually Struggle With

### The BE 2.0 Framework (Collins)
- **Vision**: Where we're going (everyone agrees)
- **Strategy**: How we'll get there (mostly aligned)
- **Objectives**: What we're doing (clear enough)
- **Tasks**: Day-to-day work (chaos)

### The Reality
- Nobody struggles with vision
- Everyone struggles with operational knowledge
- "What did we decide?"
- "Where's that document?"
- "Who owns this?"

### The Fragmentation Problem
- Slack for quick questions
- Confluence for documentation (that's outdated)
- SharePoint for official stuff (that nobody finds)
- Email for "important" things (that get buried)
- Google Docs for "collaboration" (in 47 conflicting versions)

**The documentation graveyard.**

# Organizational Knowledge Reality
## What Actually Happens in Companies

Let's talk about what organizations **actually** struggle with, not what consultants tell them they should focus on.

### The BE 2.0 Framework

Jim Collins and colleagues developed **BE 2.0** (Built to Evolve), a framework for organizational excellence with this hierarchy:

```
Vision & Mission
    ↓
Strategy
    ↓
Objectives & Key Results
    ↓
Tasks & Projects
```

It's aspirational. It's neat. It's **not where the problems are**.

### Where the Real Problems Live

**Vision & Mission**: "We'll be the leading provider of..."
- Everyone can recite it
- Leadership spent months on it
- Nobody struggles with this

**Strategy**: "We'll focus on enterprise customers in healthcare..."
- Executives aligned
- Strategy deck is polished
- Not the bottleneck

**OKRs**: "Increase NRR to 120% by Q4..."
- Goals are clear
- Metrics are defined
- Process works reasonably well

**Day-to-Day Operational Knowledge**: "What did we decide about the pricing change?"
- **THIS is where organizations bleed**
- Nobody can find the decision
- Three teams have different understandings
- The person who knows left the company

### The Questions That Actually Matter

Walk into any organization and listen to the questions people ask:

- "Wait, what did we decide in that meeting?"
- "Where's the latest version of this document?"
- "Who owns this initiative now?"
- "Why did we make that choice?"
- "What's the status of X?"
- "Has anyone tried this before?"

These are **operational knowledge questions**. And organizations are terrible at them.

### The Fragmentation Problem

Here's what "knowledge management" looks like in practice:

**Slack**
- Quick questions and real-time conversation
- Information flows fast
- Nothing is findable after 3 days

**Confluence/Notion**
- "Official" documentation
- 70% is outdated
- No one knows what's current

**SharePoint/Google Drive**
- The file cabinet
- 15 folders deep
- "Final_v3_ACTUAL_final_use_this_one.docx"

**Email**
- "Important" decisions
- Buried in threads
- Different people on different CCs

**Google Docs**
- "Collaborative" editing
- 47 conflicting versions
- "Which one is real?"

**People's Heads**
- The most current information
- Completely inaccessible
- Lost when they leave

### The Documentation Graveyard

Every organization has one:

- The wiki that was going to solve everything (3 years ago)
- The "onboarding docs" that are 70% wrong
- The "decision log" that stopped being updated after week 2
- The "lessons learned" documents nobody reads
- The "best practices" that nobody follows

Why do these fail?

1. **Documentation is work**: It competes with "real" work
2. **Documentation decays**: Outdated info is worse than no info
3. **Documentation is post-hoc**: We document after deciding, not during
4. **Nobody reads documentation**: We ask people instead

### The Real Knowledge Flow

Here's how knowledge actually flows in healthy organizations:

1. **Conversations**: People talk, relationships form, context builds
2. **Decisions emerge**: Often not in "decision meetings" but over time
3. **Action happens**: People just start doing things
4. **Others observe**: "Oh, I guess we're doing X now"
5. **Stories spread**: "Remember when we tried Y and it failed?"
6. **Culture forms**: Shared understanding that's mostly tacit

Documentation is a **trace** of this process, not the process itself.

### The Exponea Example (Revisited)

At Exponea, we scaled to hundreds of millions in revenue with almost zero formal documentation.

Knowledge lived in:
- **Code reviews**: "Why did you do it this way?"
- **Pair programming**: Working together, tacit knowledge transfer
- **Slack conversations**: Searchable, informal, real-time
- **War stories**: "Remember when the database went down at 3am?"
- **Direct mentorship**: New people shadowing experienced people

Was it perfect? No.
Did people sometimes ask the same question twice? Yes.
But did the knowledge that mattered flow to the people who needed it? **Yes.**

### What Actually Works

Instead of trying to "capture" knowledge:

1. **Make conversations searchable**: Slack beats wikis
2. **Keep critical decisions visible**: Decision records that are actually maintained
3. **Embed knowledge in process**: Checklists, templates, automation
4. **Invest in relationships**: Knowledge flows through trust
5. **Accept incompleteness**: Some knowledge will always be tacit
6. **Let old docs die**: Outdated documentation is worse than none

### The Bottom Line

Organizations don't fail because they lack vision.

They fail because:
- "We can't remember what we decided"
- "Nobody knows how this works"
- "The person who knew left"
- "We keep making the same mistakes"

**This is operational knowledge**. And it can't be solved by more wikis.
