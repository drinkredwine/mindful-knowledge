# Living What We Preach

This talk was produced by AI conversation and a multi-agent system.

**Knowledge management in action.**

## ideas
# Meta: How This Talk Was Created

### The Process
- **Conversation**: Hours of discussion about epistemology, KM, trust
- **Wiki structure**: 40+ glossary terms with bidirectional links
- **Multi-agent system**: 6 specialized agents coordinating
- **3 presentation variants**: Minimal, ideas, detailed for each slide
- **Iterative refinement**: Continuous evaluation and updating

### The Point
This isn't just **talking** about knowledge management.

This is **demonstrating** it:
- Knowledge as conversation
- AI as learning partner
- Synthesis from dialogue
- Emergence over planning

### Explore the Wiki
Every term mentioned has a glossary entry.
Every slide has 3 variants.
Every link is bidirectional.

**This is what knowledge management can be.**

## detailed
# Living What We Preach
## Meta-Reflection on This Presentation

I want to close by making the implicit explicit: **This entire talk is a demonstration of the knowledge management approach I'm advocating.**

### How This Was Created

This presentation wasn't planned top-down. It **emerged** from:

**1. Conversations**
- Hours of dialogue about epistemology, tacit knowledge, organizational reality
- Questions and challenges refining understanding
- Stories and examples bringing concepts to life
- Iterative deepening of shared context

**2. AI-Augmented Knowledge Work**
- I didn't write this alone
- AI didn't generate it independently
- We **co-created** it through dialogue
- Knowledge emerged from the interaction

**3. Multi-Agent Coordination**
- 6 specialized agents working in parallel
- Agent 1: Glossary foundation (40+ terms)
- Agent 2: Wiki infrastructure and navigation
- Agent 3: Content organization and links
- Agent 4: Visual design and layout
- Agent 5: Code implementation
- Agent 6: Slide content (these slides)

**4. Structured Knowledge**
- 40+ glossary terms with definitions
- Bidirectional links between concepts
- Multiple presentation variants (minimal/ideas/detailed)
- Navigable, explorable, interconnected

**5. Iterative Refinement**
- Continuous evaluation and feedback
- Updates based on new insights
- Refinement of language and structure
- Learning loop in action

### What This Demonstrates

**Knowledge as Process, Not Product**

We didn't:
- Start with a complete outline
- Follow a predetermined structure
- "Capture" existing knowledge

We:
- Engaged in dialogue
- Let structure emerge
- Built understanding through iteration
- Created knowledge that didn't exist before

**AI as Learning Partner**

This shows:
- Discussion → Generation → Evaluation → Refinement
- Moving fluidly across abstraction layers
- Human evaluation of AI-generated content
- Synthesis from multiple sources and conversations

**Tacit to Explicit (Sort Of)**

Could I have created this without AI? Theoretically yes.

Would I have? **No.**

The dialogue **externalized** some of my tacit understanding—but not through SECI-style "knowledge capture." Through **conversation creating new knowledge**.

What you're reading isn't my tacit knowledge transferred. It's **new knowledge co-created** through human-AI collaboration.

**Trust Over Control**

I gave agents:
- Autonomy to make decisions
- Trust to coordinate
- Freedom to interpret creatively
- Responsibility for their domains

Just like I'm trusting you to:
- Think for yourselves
- Question what I've said
- Build your own understanding
- Take this further than I imagined

### The Multi-Agent Architecture

Here's how the agents coordinated:

**Agent 1 (Glossary Foundation)**
- Created 40+ foundational terms
- Established epistemological framework
- Built conceptual vocabulary

**Agent 2 (Wiki Infrastructure)**
- Built navigation and structure
- Created landing pages
- Established information architecture

**Agent 3 (Content Organization)**
- Organized glossary sections
- Created bidirectional links
- Ensured conceptual coherence

**Agent 4 (Visual Design)**
- Designed wiki aesthetic
- Created navigation patterns
- Ensured usability

**Agent 5 (Code Implementation)**
- Built the technical infrastructure
- Implemented linking system
- Created variant switching

**Agent 6 (Slide Content)**
- Created these 13 slides
- Developed 3 variants each
- Linked to glossary terms

Each agent had autonomy. Each made decisions. The result is **emergent coordination**, not top-down control.

### What You Can Explore

**The Wiki** (`/wiki`)
- 40+ interconnected glossary terms
- Bidirectional links showing relationships
- Definitions with context and examples

**The Slides** (these!)
- 13 slides from foundations to futures
- 3 variants: minimal (visual), ideas (bullets), detailed (full)
- Switch between variants to see the same content at different depths

**The Connections**
- Every glossary term links to related concepts
- Every slide references relevant terms
- Navigate by concept, not just sequence

### The Deeper Point

**This is knowledge management:**

Not:
- Filling out templates
- Following SECI process
- Building wikis nobody updates
- Capturing knowledge in documents

But:
- Engaging in dialogue
- Building shared understanding
- Creating conditions for emergence
- Trusting people and processes

### The Invitation

Don't just read this passively.

**Engage with it:**
- Follow links that interest you
- Switch between minimal/ideas/detailed variants
- Question what resonates and what doesn't
- Build on these ideas in your own work

**Take it further:**
- Critique these frameworks
- Build better approaches
- Demonstrate in your organizations
- Show what's possible

### Living the Practice

I'm not just telling you to:
- Trust tacit knowledge (I demonstrated it by co-creating with AI)
- Question frameworks (I critiqued SECI and DIKW)
- Embrace AI collaboration (I built this through it)
- Trust students (I'm giving you the tools to question everything, including this)

**This talk practices what it preaches.**

### Final Reflection

Knowledge management isn't:
- A framework to follow
- A system to implement
- A problem to solve

Knowledge management is:
- A practice to cultivate
- A conversation to engage
- A process to trust
- A relationship to build

**This talk is one iteration of that practice.**

Now it's your turn.

What will you create?
