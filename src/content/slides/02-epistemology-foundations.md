# Justified True Belief
**Knowledge = Belief + Truth + Justification**

"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."
— Socrates

## ideas
# What Makes Something Knowledge?

- **Belief**: You must believe it
- **Truth**: It must actually be true
- **Justification**: You must have good reasons

### The Paper Exercise
Hold a piece of paper. Believe it will fall if you drop it. Drop it. Update your belief based on evidence.

### Ancient Wisdom
- **Socrates**: "I know that I know nothing" (humility opens learning)
- **Descartes**: "I think, therefore I am" (radical doubt as freedom)

## detailed
# Epistemology 101
## The Classical Definition of Knowledge

For over 2,000 years, philosophers have used this formula:

**Knowledge = Justified True Belief**

### The Three Components

1. **Belief**: You must believe the proposition
   - "I believe it will rain today"
   - Belief is a mental state—it's in your head

2. **Truth**: The proposition must actually be true
   - It must actually rain today
   - Truth is about the world—it's independent of what you think

3. **Justification**: You must have good reasons for believing it
   - "I saw dark clouds and checked the weather forecast"
   - Not just lucky guesses—you need evidence, reasoning, or reliable methods

### The Paper Flipping Exercise

Let me demonstrate how we update beliefs:

- **Before**: I believe this paper will fall if I release it (based on past experience)
- **Action**: I release the paper
- **Observation**: The paper falls
- **After**: My belief is reinforced by new evidence

This is **belief updating**—the core of learning. We form hypotheses, test them, and update our beliefs based on evidence.

### Socratic Humility

> "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." — Socrates

Socrates taught by asking questions, not giving answers. He exposed contradictions in people's beliefs, showing them they didn't know what they thought they knew.

**Why this matters for KM**: If we think we already know, we stop learning. Humility opens the door to knowledge.

### Cartesian Doubt

> "I think, therefore I am." — René Descartes

Descartes doubted everything until he found one thing he couldn't doubt: his own existence as a thinking being.

**Radical doubt as freedom**: Question all assumptions. Don't accept frameworks just because everyone uses them. This is the spirit we bring to critiquing KM models.
