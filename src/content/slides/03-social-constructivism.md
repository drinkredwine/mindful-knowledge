# Different Communities, Different Knowledge

"Scientists do not see something as something else; instead, they simply see it."
— Thomas Kuhn, *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*

## ideas
# What Counts as Valid Knowledge?

- **Academia**: Peer review, citations, methodology, reproducibility
- **Startups**: Does it work? Does it grow? Does it make money?
- **Engineering**: Does it ship? Does it scale? Does it stay up?

### The Paradigm Problem

"Marketing isn't science" assumes there's ONE right way to know.

But each community has its own **validity criteria**.

They're not wrong—they're operating in different paradigms.

## detailed
# Different Communities, Different Knowledge
## Social Constructivism and Paradigm Shifts

Here's a radical idea: **what counts as "knowledge" depends on which community you're in.**

### Thomas Kuhn's Paradigms

Thomas Kuhn revolutionized philosophy of science by showing that scientific communities operate within **paradigms**—shared frameworks that determine:

- What questions are worth asking
- What methods are valid
- What counts as evidence
- What explanations are acceptable

When paradigms shift (like from Newtonian to Einsteinian physics), it's not just new facts—it's a **whole new way of seeing the world**.

### Different Validity Criteria

Consider how different communities validate knowledge:

**Academia**
- Peer review and citations
- Methodology and reproducibility
- Theoretical coherence
- Published in recognized journals

**Startups**
- Does it attract users?
- Does it grow revenue?
- Does it solve a real problem?
- Can we build a business around it?

**Engineering**
- Does the code work?
- Does it scale to production?
- Is it maintainable?
- Does it stay up at 3am?

**Marketing**
- Does it resonate with customers?
- Does it drive conversions?
- Does it build brand value?
- Does it create desire?

### The "Marketing Isn't Science" Trap

When someone says "that's not scientific," they're often enforcing one paradigm's validity criteria on another paradigm.

But marketing knowledge is **real knowledge**—it's just validated differently. An expert marketer knows things that can't be reduced to controlled experiments.

### Social Constructivism

Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann showed that **reality is socially constructed**. We don't just discover knowledge—we create it through social processes.

**Implications for KM**:
- No single "best practice" works everywhere
- Knowledge transfer requires understanding different epistemologies
- What works in one organizational culture may fail in another
