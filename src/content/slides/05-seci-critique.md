## minimal
# The SECI Model Doesn't Work
## Consultant's Fantasy

**Socialization → Externalization → Combination → Internalization**

The problem: **Externalization is impossible.**

## ideas
# The SECI Model

- **Socialization**: Tacit → Tacit (sharing through experience)
- **Externalization**: Tacit → Explicit (writing it down)
- **Combination**: Explicit → Explicit (organizing documents)
- **Internalization**: Explicit → Tacit (reading to learn)

### Why It Fails

- **Nonaka misunderstood Polanyi**
- Tacit knowledge is **unspeakable**, not just unspoken
- Externalization doesn't "convert" knowledge—it creates NEW knowledge
- SECI assumes knowledge can be transferred like information

### The Theater of Externalization

Workshops, brainstorms, "knowledge capture sessions"—all theater pretending we can extract tacit knowledge.

## detailed
# The SECI Model Doesn't Work
## Why the Consultant's Favorite Framework Fails

Ikujiro Nonaka's **SECI model** (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) is probably the most popular framework in knowledge management. It's in every textbook, every consultant's deck, every corporate KM strategy.

**It's also fundamentally wrong.**

### The SECI Model Explained

Nonaka proposed that knowledge moves through four modes of conversion:

1. **Socialization** (Tacit → Tacit)
   - Sharing tacit knowledge through shared experience
   - Example: Apprentice learns by watching master

2. **Externalization** (Tacit → Explicit)
   - Converting tacit knowledge into explicit concepts
   - Example: Expert writes down "best practices"

3. **Combination** (Explicit → Explicit)
   - Combining different bodies of explicit knowledge
   - Example: Creating reports from multiple documents

4. **Internalization** (Explicit → Tacit)
   - Converting explicit knowledge back to tacit through practice
   - Example: Reading a manual and learning to do the task

### The Fatal Flaw: Externalization

The entire model hinges on **externalization**—the ability to convert tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.

**But Polanyi explicitly said this is impossible.**

Tacit knowledge isn't just "knowledge we haven't written down yet." It's knowledge that **fundamentally cannot be articulated**.

### Nonaka Misread Polanyi

Nonaka cited Polanyi but misunderstood him. Polanyi argued:

- Tacit knowledge is **unspeakable** (not unspoken)
- It cannot be fully codified
- Attempts to articulate it create **different knowledge**, not transferred knowledge

When an expert writes "best practices," they're not externalizing their tacit knowledge. They're creating **new explicit knowledge** that's different from the tacit knowledge they possess.

### Why Externalization is Theater

This explains why "knowledge capture sessions" feel like theater:

- Workshops where experts share "lessons learned"
- Brainstorming sessions to "document tribal knowledge"
- Exit interviews to "extract knowledge" from departing employees

These activities might create useful artifacts. But they're not capturing tacit knowledge—they're creating new explicit knowledge that's **fundamentally different** from what the expert knows tacitly.

### The Consultant's Dream

SECI is popular because it tells organizations what they want to hear:

> "Yes, you can capture your experts' knowledge in documents. Just follow our four-step process."

This sells consulting engagements. It justifies KM budgets. It promises control over the messy, uncontrollable process of organizational knowing.

**But it doesn't work.**

### What Actually Happens

- Socialization: ✓ Yes, people learn from each other
- Combination: ✓ Yes, we can organize documents
- Internalization: ✓ Yes, practice develops skill
- Externalization: ✗ **No, tacit knowledge cannot be made explicit**

Three out of four isn't bad—but the missing piece is the one everyone focuses on.
