# We Can Know More Than We Can Tell

"We know more than we can tell."
— Michael Polanyi, *The Tacit Dimension*

## ideas
# Examples of Tacit Knowledge

- **Riding a bike**: Try writing instructions that would actually work
- **Catching a ball**: You calculate trajectories without knowing calculus
- **Expert judgment**: "This doesn't feel right" (10 years of pattern recognition)
- **Playing jazz**: Reading music ≠ playing with soul

### The Problem

**This knowledge cannot be written down.**

It lives in practice, in bodies, in experience.

### Why This Matters

If knowledge is tacit, then **apprenticeship** matters more than documentation.

# We Can Know More Than We Can Tell
## Michael Polanyi and Tacit Knowledge

In 1966, Michael Polanyi published *The Tacit Dimension*, introducing one of the most important—and most ignored—concepts in knowledge management:

> "We can know more than we can tell."

### What is Tacit Knowledge?

**Tacit knowledge** is knowledge that cannot be fully articulated or codified. It's:

- Embodied in practice
- Learned through doing
- Context-dependent
- Resistant to formalization

### Classic Examples

**Riding a Bicycle**
- Try writing instructions that would let someone who's never ridden learn from text alone
- You balance, steer, and pedal through integrated bodily knowledge
- No amount of reading replaces actually riding

**Catching a Ball**
- You unconsciously calculate projectile trajectories
- You don't know the math—but your body knows the motion
- This is knowledge in action, not knowledge in books

**Expert Judgment**
- A doctor walks into a room and "just knows" something's wrong
- 10,000 hours of pattern recognition compressed into intuition
- "I can't explain why, but we need to run these tests"

**Playing Music**
- Reading notation is "knowing that"
- Playing with feeling is "knowing how"
- The difference between technical proficiency and artistry

### Knowing-How vs. Knowing-That vs. Knowing

Polanyi distinguished:

- **Knowing-that**: Propositional knowledge ("Paris is the capital of France")
- **Knowing-how**: Skill-based knowledge ("I know how to ride a bike")
- **Knowing**: Direct acquaintance ("I know Paris")

Traditional KM focuses obsessively on knowing-that. But most valuable organizational knowledge is knowing-how and knowing.

### Implications for Knowledge Management

If knowledge is fundamentally tacit, then:

1. **Documentation has limits**: You can't write down what matters most
2. **Apprenticeship is essential**: Learning by doing with experts
3. **Communities of practice**: Knowledge lives in relationships
4. **Experience trumps process**: Manuals can't replace mastery

This is why mentorship, pair programming, shadowing, and working together matter more than wikis and documentation.
