# 7 Attitudes for Knowledge Work

- **Non-Judging**: Observe without immediately categorizing as good/bad
- **Patience**: Let understanding develop naturally
- **Beginner's Mind**: "I don't know" opens learning
- **Trust**: In yourself, your process, your intuition
- **Non-Striving**: Be present rather than constantly achieving
- **Acceptance**: See things as they are, not as you wish
- **Letting Go**: Release attachment to being right

### From Ancient Wisdom to Modern Science

Jon Kabat-Zinn brought Buddhist mindfulness into Western medicine.

**These attitudes apply to knowledge work.**

## detailed
# 7 Mindfulness Attitudes
## An Alternative Framework for Knowledge Work

Jon Kabat-Zinn developed **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)** by bringing ancient Buddhist practices into Western medicine. His framework rests on seven foundational attitudes.

**What if these attitudes are better guidance for knowledge management than SECI or DIKW?**

### The Seven Attitudes

**1. Non-Judging**

Observe experiences without immediately labeling them as good or bad.

- In KM: Don't dismiss ideas as "not invented here" or "already tried that"
- Listen to what's actually being said, not what you expect
- Create space for unexpected insights

**2. Patience**

Understanding takes time. Let it develop naturally.

- In KM: Deep knowledge isn't captured in a 30-minute workshop
- Relationships take time to build trust
- Learning has its own rhythm—respect it

**3. Beginner's Mind**

Approach everything as if for the first time. "I don't know" is the gateway to learning.

- In KM: Expertise can blind us to new possibilities
- Question assumptions, even (especially) your own
- The most innovative insights come from fresh perspectives

**4. Trust**

Trust in yourself, your intuition, your process.

- In KM: Trust your tacit knowledge—"it doesn't feel right" is data
- Trust the people you work with
- Trust that knowledge emerges from authentic engagement

**5. Non-Striving**

Be fully present rather than constantly achieving goals.

- In KM: Stop trying to "capture" knowledge and start creating conditions for it to emerge
- The best conversations happen when you're not trying to extract "deliverables"
- Being is as important as doing

**6. Acceptance**

See things as they actually are, not as you wish them to be.

- In KM: Accept that some knowledge can't be documented
- Accept that people learn differently
- Accept organizational reality rather than fighting it

**7. Letting Go**

Release attachment to outcomes, to being right, to how things "should" be.

- In KM: Let go of the fantasy that we can control knowledge
- Let go of failed frameworks (even if they're industry standard)
- Let go of ego attachment to your ideas

### Why This Works Better

Unlike SECI and DIKW, these attitudes:

- **Acknowledge tacit knowledge**: They're about being, not just knowing-that
- **Respect emergence**: Knowledge isn't manufactured; it emerges
- **Center relationships**: Knowing happens between people
- **Embrace uncertainty**: Not knowing is the starting point
- **Focus on practice**: These are ways of being, not steps to follow

### From Buddhism to Boardrooms

Kabat-Zinn's genius was translating 2,500-year-old Buddhist wisdom into a framework that worked in Western hospitals, corporations, and universities.

**We can do the same for knowledge management.**

Instead of consultants' models that don't work, we can draw on wisdom traditions that have cultivated knowledge for millennia.
