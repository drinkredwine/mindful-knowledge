# The DIKW Pyramid is Backwards

**Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom**

Where is learning by doing?

## ideas
# The DIKW Pyramid Problem

The pyramid suggests:
- Collect **data**
- Process into **information**
- Synthesize into **knowledge**
- Distill into **wisdom**

### What's Missing?

- **Doing**: Actually building things
- **Failing**: Learning from mistakes
- **Working with people**: Collaboration and conflict
- **Experience**: The messy reality of practice

### The Startup Reality

Exponea became a $1bn company with almost zero documentation.

Knowledge lived in:
- Conversations
- Code reviews
- Pair programming
- War stories
- Shared struggles

# The DIKW Pyramid is Backwards
## Why the Hierarchy Gets Learning Wrong

The **DIKW Pyramid** (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) is another beloved KM framework. It suggests a neat hierarchy:

```
        Wisdom
       Knowledge
      Information
         Data
```

The implicit message: collect data, process it up the pyramid, and you'll achieve wisdom.

**This is backwards.**

### The Pyramid's Logic

**Data**: Raw facts and figures
- "User clicked button at 14:32"
- "Temperature is 23°C"

**Information**: Data with context and meaning
- "User engagement dropped 15% after redesign"
- "It's warmer than usual for March"

**Knowledge**: Information with understanding
- "Dark patterns reduce long-term retention"
- "Climate patterns are shifting"

**Wisdom**: Knowledge with judgment
- "Optimize for lifetime value, not clicks"
- "We must adapt our agricultural practices"

### What's Wrong With This?

The pyramid assumes knowledge flows **upward from data**.

But in reality, the most valuable knowledge comes from:

1. **Doing things**: Building, shipping, iterating
2. **Failing**: Learning what doesn't work
3. **Working with people**: Navigating conflicts, building trust
4. **Living through experiences**: Context that can't be databased

### The Exponea Story

I joined Exponea (acquired for $600M+, now valued over $1bn) early on. We had:

- Almost **no documentation**
- No formal processes
- No knowledge base
- No "best practices" wiki

We had:

- **Constant conversation**
- Code reviews and pair programming
- War stories from production fires
- Mentorship and shadowing
- Shared context from building together

The knowledge that made the company valuable wasn't captured in documents. It lived in the **practices, relationships, and tacit understanding** of the team.

### Where's the Learning Loop?

The DIKW pyramid is **static**. It doesn't show:

- The **feedback loop** of trying → failing → learning
- The **social dimension** of knowledge creation
- The **embodied experience** that develops expertise
- The **context** that makes knowledge meaningful

Real learning looks more like:

```
Try something → Observe results → Update beliefs → Try again
         ↑                                            ↓
         └────────────── Feedback loop ───────────────┘
```

### Knowledge Without Data

Much valuable knowledge comes without data:

- "This team doesn't trust each other" (felt in meetings)
- "This design will confuse users" (intuition from experience)
- "This approach won't scale" (pattern recognition)

These insights don't come from processing data up a pyramid. They come from **tacit knowledge, social intelligence, and embodied experience**.

### The Real Pyramid

If we must have a pyramid, flip it:

```
         Data
      Information
      Knowledge
        Wisdom
    (grounded in experience, practice, and relationships)
```

Wisdom isn't distilled from data. Wisdom is **developed through living**, and then we use data to test and refine it.
