# Knowing-How vs Knowing-That

A fundamental distinction in epistemology between practical knowledge (knowing how to do something) and propositional knowledge (knowing that something is true). Philosopher Gilbert Ryle argued these are fundamentally different types of knowledge, not just different expressions of the same thing.

## Core Concept

**Knowing-that** (propositional knowledge):
- Facts, theories, explanations
- Can be stated in declarative sentences
- Examples: "Paris is the capital of France," "Water is H₂O," "MapReduce distributes computation across nodes"

**Knowing-how** (practical knowledge):
- Skills, abilities, competencies
- Demonstrated through action
- Examples: Riding a bicycle, playing chess, debugging complex systems

**Ryle's key argument**: You can't reduce knowing-how to knowing-that. Knowing all the facts about bicycle physics doesn't mean you know how to ride a bike. And knowing how to ride a bike doesn't require knowing the physics.

## Context from Conversation

This distinction was used to show the layers of knowledge in technical work:

**Three levels of knowledge** (using distributed systems as example):

1. **Knowing-that**: "MapReduce distributes computation across nodes"
   - Can learn from reading
   - Propositional, explicit
   - What most documentation captures

2. **Knowing-how**: Actually building and operating distributed systems
   - Requires doing
   - Practical, often tacit
   - What apprenticeship and experience develop

3. **Knowing** (deep expertise): Intuition for when to use what approach, what's possible, what will break
   - Requires years of being in it
   - Highly tacit, judgment-based
   - What distinguishes experienced practitioners

**The point**: Reading documentation gives you knowing-that. But valuable knowledge work requires knowing-how and deep knowing - which come from practice, not documentation.

## Why Documentation Isn't Enough

This explains why knowledge management systems focused on capturing and sharing documents (knowing-that) miss most of what makes experts valuable:

- **Junior developer**: Reads about design patterns (knowing-that)
- **Mid-level developer**: Can apply patterns in context (knowing-how)
- **Senior developer**: Knows when to break the patterns, sees larger architectural implications (deep knowing)

You can't shortcut from level 1 to level 3 by reading more documentation. You need practice, experience, mistakes, feedback - the messy process of developing knowing-how.

## Apprenticeship > Documentation

The implication: **apprenticeship > documentation, doing > reading**

Traditional apprenticeship worked because:
- Novices worked alongside masters
- They developed knowing-how through practice
- They absorbed tacit knowledge through participation
- They built judgment through experience

Modern "knowledge management" often tries to replace this with documents. But you can't document knowing-how - you have to develop it through practice.

## The Intellectualist Legend

Ryle called the view that all knowing-how reduces to knowing-that the "intellectualist legend" - the mistaken belief that doing something skillfully requires first knowing rules or principles, then applying them.

**Reality**: Most skilled action happens without consulting internal rules:
- Expert drivers don't consciously recall driving rules
- Experienced cooks don't mentally recite recipes
- Senior engineers don't consciously apply frameworks - they've internalized them

The skill IS the knowing-how, not the application of knowing-that.
