Non-judging is the practice of observing your experience without immediately categorizing it as good or bad, right or wrong, valuable or worthless.

## The Problem with Constant Evaluation

"We judge, eval everything too fast. Quick shortcuts—this is good, this is bad—kills ideas before they breathe."

Our minds constantly evaluate:
- "That's not scientific" → dismissed
- "Marketing isn't rigorous" → dismissed
- "That's just anecdotal" → dismissed
- "That's too theoretical" → dismissed

These quick judgments protect us from information overload, but they also close us off from learning. Ideas die before we've actually examined them.

## Epistemic Consequences

In knowledge work, premature judgment:

**Narrows sources**: Only certain kinds of knowledge count as valid

**Reinforces biases**: We accept ideas that fit our frameworks, reject those that challenge them

**Kills creativity**: Novel ideas often seem wrong at first

**Stops dialogue**: Judgment ends conversation before understanding begins

## Not the Same as Accepting Everything

Non-judging doesn't mean believing everything or having no standards. It means:

1. **First, observe**: What's actually being said?
2. **Then, understand**: What perspective does this come from?
3. **Only then, evaluate**: How does this fit with what I know?

The judgment comes later, after genuine observation and understanding. Most of the time, we skip straight to judgment.

## Practice

Notice when you're judging:
- "That's stupid"
- "Obviously wrong"
- "Everyone knows that's not how it works"

Pause. Ask instead:
- "What would make someone think this?"
- "What am I missing?"
- "What could I learn here?"

You might still reject the idea. But you'll do it with understanding, not reflexive dismissal.
