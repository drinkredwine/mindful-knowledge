Explicit knowledge is knowledge that can be articulated, codified, and stored in documents, databases, or other external formats. It's knowledge that can be written down and shared.

## Characteristics

**Articulable**: Can be put into words, symbols, or other representations

**Transferable**: Can be passed from one person to another through documentation

**Stored**: Can be captured in books, manuals, databases, or other media

**Independent**: Exists separately from the knower (at least in theory)

## Examples

- Mathematical formulas
- Documented procedures
- Written instructions
- Recorded facts
- Codified rules
- Database entries

## The Explicit Bias

Knowledge management systems often focus exclusively on explicit knowledge because it's:
- Easy to capture in systems
- Transferable through technology
- Measurable and quantifiable
- Manageable through processes

This creates an **explicit bias**: the assumption that if we can't write it down, it isn't really knowledge worth managing.

## The Problem

Most valuable organizational knowledge is actually **tacit** - it exists in people's skills, judgment, and experience. Focusing only on explicit knowledge means missing most of what matters.

As Polanyi noted: **"We can know more than we can tell."**

The explicit/tacit distinction isn't absolute. They exist on a spectrum, and much knowledge has both explicit and tacit dimensions.

## In Practice

**What gets documented** (explicit):
- Step-by-step procedures
- Lists of best practices
- Templates and frameworks
- Rules and policies

**What stays tacit**:
- When to apply which procedure
- How to adapt templates to context
- Judgment about exceptions to rules
- Skill in execution

## The Externalization Challenge

Organizations often try to make tacit knowledge explicit through:
- Documentation projects
- Best practice capture
- Lessons learned databases
- Knowledge transfer programs

But there's an [externalization problem](/glossary/externalization-problem): much tacit knowledge resists being made explicit.
