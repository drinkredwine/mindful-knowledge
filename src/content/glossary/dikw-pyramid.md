The DIKW Pyramid (Data ’ Information ’ Knowledge ’ Wisdom) is a hierarchical model suggesting knowledge is built by processing data upward through increasingly refined stages. It implies a linear, bottom-up progression.

## The Critique

"This knowledge pyramid is what I hate. Where is experience, learning by doing?"

The DIKW model presents knowledge creation as a straightforward upward transformation:
- **Data**: Raw facts
- **Information**: Organized data
- **Knowledge**: Applied information
- **Wisdom**: Judged knowledge

### What's Missing

**Experience and Learning by Doing**: The pyramid shows only abstract processing of information. Where is hands-on practice? Where is experiential learning?

**Feedback Loops**: Real learning isn't linear. You try something (action), see what happens (experience), update your understanding (knowledge), and try again. The DIKW pyramid has no loops.

**Tacit Knowledge**: Skills, intuitions, and embodied know-how don't fit this model. You can't reduce riding a bike to "processed data."

**Context**: Knowledge in practice depends heavily on situation and context, not just information processing.

## The Startup Reality

In a startup context, knowledge creation looks more like:

1. **Try something** (build a feature, launch a campaign)
2. **See what happens** (users engage or ignore it)
3. **Update understanding** (learn what actually works)
4. **Try again differently** (iterate based on experience)

This is experiential learning, not information hierarchy.

## Why It Persists

The DIKW model persists in knowledge management because:
- It's simple and visual
- It fits organizational information systems (databases, reports, analytics)
- It flatters the idea that wisdom comes from accumulating information

But it misses how humans actually learn and create knowledge in practice.

## Alternative View

Instead of a pyramid, think of knowledge as:
- **Process not state**: Knowledge emerges through action and reflection
- **Embodied and tacit**: Much knowledge is in skilled practice, not explicit information
- **Contextual and social**: Knowledge works in communities of practice, not in isolation
- **Iterative**: Learning loops matter more than linear hierarchies
