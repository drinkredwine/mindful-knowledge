# Paradigm Shift

A fundamental change in the basic concepts, assumptions, and practices that define a field of inquiry. Introduced by Thomas Kuhn in *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* (1962), this concept revolutionized our understanding of how science actually works - not as steady accumulation of truth, but through revolutionary changes in worldview.

## Core Concept

**Paradigm**: A framework of assumptions, methods, and standards that define "normal science" in a field. It determines what questions are worth asking, what counts as evidence, and what solutions are acceptable.

**How science actually works (according to Kuhn)**:

1. **Normal science**: Scientists work within a paradigm, solving puzzles and making incremental progress
2. **Anomalies accumulate**: Observations that don't fit the paradigm pile up
3. **Crisis**: The anomalies become too significant to ignore
4. **Revolution**: A new paradigm emerges that explains both old phenomena and troubling anomalies
5. **New normal science**: The new paradigm becomes standard, and the cycle begins again

**Example**: Ptolemaic astronomy (Earth-centered) → Copernican revolution (Sun-centered). For centuries, astronomers made the Earth-centered model work with increasingly complex adjustments. Eventually, the Sun-centered model explained things more simply.

## Context from Conversation

The paradigm concept was invoked to challenge gatekeeping statements like "marketing isn't science" or "only academic research produces valid knowledge."

**The point**: Different fields operate within different paradigms with different standards for what counts as justified belief:

- **Academic science**: Peer review, replication, statistical significance
- **Startups**: Customer validation, market response, iteration speed
- **Engineering**: Does it work? Does it scale? Can we maintain it?

Saying "marketing isn't science" is paradigm thinking - assuming the scientific paradigm is the *only* valid way to produce knowledge. But [social constructivism](/glossary/social-constructivism) shows us that different communities construct different valid forms of knowledge.

**The trap**: People working within a paradigm often can't see outside it. They resist alternative approaches not because they're closed-minded, but because the paradigm structures what counts as legitimate knowledge. This is why true paradigm shifts feel like conversions rather than logical conclusions.

## Implications for Knowledge Management

1. **Different communities, different paradigms**: Engineers, marketers, researchers all have valid but different frameworks for what counts as knowledge
2. **Tacit assumptions**: Much of a paradigm is [tacit knowledge](/glossary/tacit-knowledge) - you absorb it by being in the community, not by reading documentation
3. **Resistance to change**: KM initiatives often fail because they try to impose one paradigm's knowledge practices on another paradigm's community

- [Social Constructivism](/glossary/social-constructivism) - Knowledge is constructed within communities, not discovered as universal truth
- [Epistemic Communities](/glossary/epistemic-communities) - Groups that share criteria for what counts as knowledge
- [Tacit Knowledge](/glossary/tacit-knowledge) - Much of a paradigm's assumptions are tacit, not explicit
