Communities of Practice are groups of people who share a concern or passion for something they do and learn how to do it better through regular interaction. The concept, developed by Etienne Wenger and Jean Lave, explains how learning happens in real-world social contexts.

## Knowledge Lives in Communities

"The company WAS the knowledge—the collective capability to solve customer data problems."

Knowledge doesn't primarily live in documents or databases. It lives in communities working together on real problems. The community knows things that no individual member can fully articulate.

## Three Elements

Communities of practice have:

**Domain**: Shared area of interest or expertise
**Community**: Relationships and interactions among members
**Practice**: Shared repertoire of resources—stories, tools, ways of addressing problems

## How Learning Happens

In communities of practice, learning is:

**Situated**: Happens while doing real work, not in abstract training

**Social**: Through participation, observation, collaboration

**Identity-forming**: Becoming a practitioner means becoming part of the community

**Emergent**: The community's collective knowledge evolves through practice

## Not Just Teams

A community of practice is different from a formal team:

- **Voluntary**: Members join because they care about the domain
- **Self-organizing**: Emerges from practice, not org chart
- **Permeable**: Membership is fluid, expertise varies
- **Long-lived**: Outlasts specific projects or teams

## Why They Matter

Organizations often try to manage knowledge by creating documents and databases. But the real knowledge lives in communities: the unwritten norms, the quick Slack exchanges, the "ask Jamie, she knows that system," the shared experience of what worked and what didn't.

You can't capture community knowledge in a wiki. You can support the community, give it space to practice together, and let the knowledge keep living and evolving through ongoing interaction.
