# Tacit Knowledge

Knowledge that cannot be fully articulated or written down - you know more than you can tell. Introduced by philosopher Michael Polanyi in *The Tacit Dimension* (1966), this concept is central to understanding why knowledge management is so much harder than information management.

## Core Concept

**Polanyi's famous quote**: "We can know more than we can tell."

**Examples of tacit knowledge**:
- **Riding a bicycle**: Try writing instructions that would let someone who's never ridden learn to ride just by reading. You can't. They have to practice.
- **Catching a ball**: You don't calculate trajectories consciously; your body knows how
- **Expert judgment**: Experienced doctors, engineers, designers make judgments that "feel right" but they can't fully explain why
- **Face recognition**: You can recognize thousands of faces but can't articulate the rules you're using

**The key distinction**:
- **Explicit knowledge**: Can be written down, transferred through documentation
- **Tacit knowledge**: Resides in practice, skill, intuition, embodied experience

## Context from Conversation

Tacit knowledge was central to the critique of traditional knowledge management systems:

**The problem**: Most KM initiatives assume knowledge is like information - you can extract it from experts' heads, codify it in documents, store it in databases, and transfer it to others through reading.

**Why this fails**: Much genuine knowledge is tacit. It's not that experts are refusing to share or being lazy about documentation. It's that the knowledge is *fundamentally non-articulable*.

**Examples from the talk**:
- You can read about distributed systems, but building them requires tacit knowledge gained through practice
- You can read meeting notes, but the real knowledge from the meeting includes context, tone, relationships - mostly tacit
- You can document a process, but experts have tacit judgment about when to follow it and when to adapt

## Why It Matters

**For learning**: You can't learn tacit knowledge just by reading. You need:
- **Practice**: Actually doing the thing
- **Apprenticeship**: Learning alongside someone who has the tacit knowledge
- **Experience**: Building your own embodied understanding through repetition
- **Community**: Participating in the practices where tacit knowledge lives

**For knowledge management**: Traditional KM systems fundamentally misunderstand what they're trying to capture. The slogan "make tacit knowledge explicit" sounds good but is often impossible. You can't turn bike-riding skill into a document.

## Not All Knowledge Is Tacit

Important nuance: Tacit knowledge exists alongside explicit knowledge. Some things *can* be written down:
- Facts (explicit)
- Procedures (explicit, though applying them may involve tacit judgment)
- Principles (explicit, though knowing when they apply may be tacit)
- Data (explicit)

The problem is when we *assume* everything can be made explicit, or when we treat tacit knowledge as just "not yet documented" rather than *fundamentally different*.

## The SECI Model

Nonaka and Takeuchi's [SECI model](/glossary/seci-model) tries to address this by describing knowledge conversion:
- **Socialization**: Tacit to tacit (apprenticeship)
- **Externalization**: Tacit to explicit (documentation, but limited)
- **Combination**: Explicit to explicit (organizing information)
- **Internalization**: Explicit to tacit (learning by doing)

But the model's "externalization" step is where many KM initiatives fail - they assume all tacit knowledge *can* be externalized if you just try hard enough.
