# Socratic Method

A method of inquiry developed by the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, based on asking probing questions to examine assumptions, expose contradictions, and reveal the limits of what we know. Famous for Socrates' claim: "I know that I know nothing" (*ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα*).

## Core Concept

The Socratic method works through dialogue:

1. Someone makes a claim (e.g., "Knowledge management captures organizational knowledge")
2. Socrates asks clarifying questions ("What is knowledge?" "What does it mean to capture it?")
3. Through questioning, contradictions or gaps in understanding emerge
4. The person realizes they don't understand the topic as well as they thought
5. This recognition of ignorance becomes the starting point for genuine learning

**The paradox**: Socrates claimed to be the wisest person precisely *because* he recognized how little he knew, while others falsely believed they had knowledge.

## Context from Conversation

The Socratic approach was central to the epistemology talk's opening move: instead of immediately accepting the premise of "knowledge management" and diving into tools, we questioned the assumptions themselves.

This stands in stark contrast to what was called "trust only science" gatekeeping - the attitude that only certain certified experts have valid knowledge, and everyone else should shut up and listen. The Socratic position is more humble: *everyone*, including experts, should recognize the limits of their knowledge.

**Real-world implication**: A marketing professional who says "I don't know if this will work, let's test it" is being more Socratic (and more scientific) than someone who gatekeeps with "marketing isn't science, only academics know truth."

## The Socratic Paradox

"I know that I know nothing" seems contradictory - if you know nothing, how can you know *that*? But the point is about epistemic humility: the recognition that our knowledge is always limited, provisional, and open to revision. This isn't paralyzing skepticism; it's the foundation for genuine inquiry.
