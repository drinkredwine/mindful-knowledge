"You don't know what you think until you say it."

Discussion isn't knowledge transfer. It's knowledge emergence. Tacit knowledge surfaces through dialogue, becoming clearer to the speaker even as they articulate it.

## Not Guru → Student

The traditional model: the expert transfers knowledge to the novice through explanation. The expert knows, the student receives.

This misses how dialogue actually works. Speaking forces articulation. Questions reveal gaps. Push-back refines thinking. Both participants leave knowing more than when they started.

## Peer → Peer

The most productive discussions happen between peers working on shared problems. Not because everyone knows the same amount, but because:

- **Safety to explore**: No pressure to perform expertise
- **Mutual challenge**: Both can question assumptions
- **Shared context**: Common ground to build from
- **Collaborative discovery**: Finding answers together

## Knowledge Surfaces

Through discussion, tacit knowledge becomes visible:

- "I never thought about it that way before"
- "I guess I do X because of Y"
- "Wait, that doesn't make sense when I say it out loud"
- "Now I see the pattern I was missing"

The knowledge wasn't transferred from one person to another. It emerged in the space between them through the process of trying to articulate, explain, and understand together.

## Practical Applications

**Code reviews**: Not just catching bugs, but surfacing design intuitions

**Pair programming**: Two people thinking out loud together

**Study groups**: Peers teaching each other by trying to explain

**AI dialogue**: Articulating thoughts to an AI partner who asks good questions

The goal isn't to download knowledge from expert to novice. It's to create conditions where knowledge can emerge for everyone involved.
