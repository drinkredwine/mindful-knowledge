# Operational Knowledge

The knowledge of what happened recently, what's happening right now, and what shall happen next. Today, this week, this quarter. This is living, breathing, constantly changing knowledge.

## What It Is

Operational knowledge is the lifeblood of actual work:

- **What happened**: Meeting decisions, design iterations, why approach X was rejected
- **What's happening**: Who's working on what, blockers, current status
- **What's next**: Immediate priorities, handoffs, dependencies

This is not the grand vision or the five-year strategy. This is "the database migration is delayed because the staging environment broke" and "we decided to use PostgreSQL, the decision is in that Slack thread from Tuesday."

## Why It Matters More Than Vision

Organizations spend enormous energy on vision statements, mission documents, and strategic frameworks. These matter, but nobody struggles with "what's our vision?"

The real struggles:

- "What did we decide about X last week?"
- "Where is that documented?"
- "Who has context on this?"
- "Why did we choose this approach?"
- "What's the current status?"

Operational knowledge is where the actual friction lives. It's where miscommunication happens, where context gets lost, where new people get confused, where decisions get re-litigated because nobody remembers we already decided.

## Characteristics

Operational knowledge is:

- **High velocity**: Changes constantly, sometimes multiple times per day
- **Distributed**: Lives in many places and many people's heads
- **Contextual**: Meaning depends heavily on timing and situation
- **Fragmented**: Rarely captured systematically
- **Tacit**: Much of it never gets written down at all

## Where It Lives (and Dies)

Operational knowledge exists in:

- **Slack threads**: Rich context buried in chronological streams
- **Email chains**: Lost in inboxes, context scattered across replies
- **Meetings**: Evaporates unless someone takes good notes
- **Code repositories**: Commit messages and PR comments
- **People's heads**: The most common and most fragile storage

Traditional knowledge management tools fail here because they're designed for stable, structured knowledge. Operational knowledge is too fast, too messy, too contextual for wikis and document repositories.

## The Documentation Paradox

You can't document everything - there's too much, it changes too fast, and writing it all down would stop actual work from happening.

But you also can't document nothing - that leads to chaos, lost context, and constant interruptions ("Hey, quick question...").

The challenge is finding the right level of capture that:

- **Preserves critical context** without bureaucratic overhead
- **Surfaces at the right time** when someone needs it
- **Stays findable** as the organization grows
- **Emerges from work** rather than requiring separate documentation work

## Connection to AI

This is where AI as learning partner becomes relevant. You can't hand-craft documentation for operational knowledge - there's too much, it changes too fast. But you can have conversations with AI that:

- Capture context naturally through discussion
- Get indexed and searchable automatically
- Can be queried in natural language
- Build up over time without explicit structuring

The limit is no longer AI's ability to generate knowledge - it can generate unlimited tokens. The limit is your attention: knowing what to capture, what deserves discussion, what needs to be preserved.

## In Practice

Good operational knowledge management means:

- **Quick capture**: Low friction for recording decisions and context
- **Good search**: Find things when you need them
- **Context preservation**: Not just what was decided, but why
- **Temporal awareness**: Knowing when information is from matters
- **Progressive disclosure**: See summaries first, drill down when needed

## The Strategic vs Operational Balance

Organizations need both strategic knowledge (vision, values, long-term direction) and operational knowledge (what's happening now, recent decisions, current status).

The mistake is treating them the same way. Strategic knowledge works in frameworks, documents, and hierarchies. Operational knowledge needs search, conversation, and emergence.

Most organizations have too much strategic planning infrastructure and too little operational knowledge infrastructure. That's why people can recite the vision but can't find last week's decision.
