# BE 2.0 Framework (Jim Collins)

An opinionated skeleton of a company's knowledge map. The aspirational architecture of intent.

## The Hierarchy

**Vision** → **Mission** → **Core Beliefs & Values** → **BHAG** → **Strategy** → **OKRs** → **Roadmap** → **Tasks**

This framework provides a structured cascade from the most abstract (vision) to the most concrete (tasks). Each level should inform and constrain the levels below it.

## What It Is

The BE 2.0 Framework is Jim Collins' systematic approach to translating organizational aspiration into executable action. It creates a coherent chain from "why we exist" (vision) through "what we're trying to achieve" (BHAG) down to "what we're doing this week" (tasks).

## Why It Matters

Every organization has vision statements. Most collect dust on walls or in PowerPoint decks. The BE 2.0 Framework matters because it:

- **Creates alignment** across all levels of the organization
- **Makes the abstract actionable** by forcing explicit connections between levels
- **Enables decision-making** by providing a clear hierarchy of intent
- **Reveals gaps** between what you say you believe and what you actually do

## The Problem It Solves

Organizations frequently suffer from a disconnect between strategic intent and operational reality. People know the vision but don't know how their daily work connects to it. The BE 2.0 Framework makes that connection explicit and traceable.

## What It Doesn't Solve

The framework provides structure for strategic knowledge - the aspirational, relatively stable elements of organizational identity. It doesn't capture operational knowledge: what happened in yesterday's meeting, what the team decided about the database migration, why feature X was delayed.

Strategic knowledge is important but it's not where organizations struggle most. Nobody asks "what's our vision?" The real questions are: "What did we decide last week? Who's working on what? Where did we document that decision?"

## In Practice

A well-implemented BE 2.0 Framework means:

- **Every OKR traces to strategy**, which traces to BHAG, which traces to values
- **Every task connects upward** through roadmap and OKRs to strategic intent
- **Decisions become easier** because the framework provides a filter
- **Misalignment becomes visible** when tasks don't connect to anything higher

## The Limits of Vision

This framework is the skeleton. But organizations are not just skeletons - they're living organisms. The muscle, blood, and daily metabolism happen in:

- Slack threads
- Email chains
- Meeting decisions
- Code commits
- Customer conversations
- Bug reports
- Design iterations

This operational knowledge is fragmented everywhere, mostly tacit, mostly lost. The BE 2.0 Framework gives you structure for the 1% that is vision. You still need to solve the 99% that is operations.

## Connection to Knowledge Management

The framework is valuable precisely because it creates a stable reference point. While operational knowledge churns constantly, strategic knowledge provides continuity. The challenge is not choosing between them - you need both. The challenge is giving each the right tool and the right attention.

Vision frameworks like BE 2.0 work well in documents, hierarchies, and static knowledge bases. Operational knowledge needs different infrastructure: searchable, living, constantly updated, emerging from the flow of work rather than imposed from above.
