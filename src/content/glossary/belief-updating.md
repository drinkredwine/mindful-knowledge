# Belief Updating

The process of revising your beliefs based on new evidence or information. This is what learning actually *is* at a cognitive level - not acquiring truth, but continuously updating your mental models as you encounter new experiences.

## Core Concept

**The paper exercise** (from the talk):

1. I show you a piece of paper with something written on one side
2. I ask: "What's on the other side?"
3. You make a guess based on whatever information you have
4. I flip the paper and you see what's actually there
5. You update your belief

**Key insight**: There's no stress in this process. You're not trying to GET IT RIGHT with absolute certainty. You're just:
- Making your best guess with available information
- Observing what happens
- Updating your model
- Repeating

This is a fundamental model for all learning, from scientific experiments to everyday experience.

## Why This Matters

Traditional views of learning often emphasize:
- Finding THE TRUTH
- Getting the right answer
- Avoiding being wrong

But belief updating reframes learning as:
- Having provisional models that work for now
- Testing them against reality
- Revising as needed
- No shame in being wrong - that's just new information

**Connection to [Cartesian Doubt](/glossary/cartesian-doubt)**: Once you accept that nothing (except your existence) is 100% certain, belief updating becomes natural. You're not abandoning truth; you're recognizing that all knowledge is provisional and evidence-based.

## Context from Conversation

The paper exercise was used to demystify learning and remove anxiety:

- **No guru needed**: You don't need an authority figure to tell you what's on the other side. You can look for yourself.
- **No failure**: Being wrong isn't failure; it's information
- **Continuous process**: Learning never stops because evidence keeps coming
- **Freedom**: You can trust yourself to observe, interpret, and update

This connects to the broader theme of [uncertainty as freedom](/glossary/uncertainty-as-freedom): when you stop seeking absolute certainty and embrace belief updating, you become more confident (paradoxically) because you trust your ability to learn and adapt.

## Bayesian Thinking

In more formal terms, belief updating is how Bayesian probability works:
- Start with prior beliefs (your best guess)
- Encounter new evidence
- Update to posterior beliefs (your revised guess)
- These become your new priors for the next update

You don't need to understand Bayesian math to practice belief updating - you do it naturally whenever you genuinely learn from experience.

- [Cartesian Doubt](/glossary/cartesian-doubt) - Accepting uncertainty makes belief updating natural rather than threatening
