"It's a process not a state."

The Learning Loop is a continuous cycle of learning, action, and reflection:

**Discuss with AI** → **Reflect** → **Decide** → **Act** → **Get Feedback** → **Update Beliefs** → **Repeat**

## Not a Pipeline

This isn't a linear pipeline where you "do knowledge management" once and you're done. It's a continuous spiral. Each cycle builds on the last. Your understanding evolves. Your questions get better. Your actions become more effective.

## The Artifacts are Trails

The things you produce—code, documents, notes, models—aren't the knowledge. They're trails left by the learning process. They're useful for:
- Sharing context with others
- Triggering memories later
- Seeing how your thinking evolved
- Enabling collaboration

But the knowledge itself lives in your updated capacity to think and act differently.

## Staying in the Loop

The challenge isn't completing the loop once. It's staying in it. This requires:

**Beginner's mind**: Staying open to updating your understanding

**Feedback seeking**: Actively looking for signals that challenge your beliefs

**Reflection**: Taking time to process what you're learning

**Humility**: Accepting you'll need to keep learning forever

## With AI Partners

AI can accelerate the learning loop:
- Discuss ideas to clarify thinking
- Get rapid feedback on approaches
- Explore alternatives quickly
- Update mental models iteratively

But the loop still requires you. AI can't do the reflecting, deciding, or real-world acting. It's a partner in the process, not a replacement for it.
