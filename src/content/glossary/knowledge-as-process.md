"Knowledge management isn't about storing knowledge. It's about staying in the learning loop."

## The Old Model

Traditional knowledge management treats knowledge as a static asset to be:
- Captured from experts
- Stored in databases
- Retrieved when needed
- Applied to problems

This model assumes knowledge is a thing you can possess, preserve, and transfer like files on a hard drive.

## The Process View

Knowledge is better understood as an ongoing process of:
- Learning from experience
- Doing and experimenting
- Getting feedback
- Updating understanding
- Repeating the cycle

The artifacts we create—code, documentation, models—are trails of the learning process, not the knowledge itself. They're useful markers, but the knowledge lives in the capacity to continue learning and adapting.

## Implications for KM

If knowledge is process, not state:

**Stop trying to capture and store everything.** You can't freeze knowledge like a snapshot.

**Focus on enabling continuous learning.** Create systems that support the learning loop: discuss→reflect→decide→act→feedback→update→repeat.

**Value recency over completeness.** Recent, partial knowledge actively being updated beats comprehensive but stale documentation.

**Design for flow, not stock.** Instead of knowledge repositories, build knowledge streams—ongoing conversations, living documentation, continuous integration of learning.

## The Company as Learning System

"The company WAS the knowledge—the collective capability to solve customer data problems."

Knowledge doesn't live in documents. It lives in the organization's ability to keep learning, adapting, and improving together. The process is the point.
