# Social Constructivism

The view that knowledge is not simply discovered as objective truth "out there" in the world, but is actively *constructed* through social processes within communities. Different communities can construct different valid forms of knowledge with different criteria for what counts as justified belief.

## Core Concept

**Key claim**: What counts as "knowledge" depends on the social context:

- **In academic science**: Knowledge requires peer review, replication studies, statistical significance, published papers
- **In startups**: Knowledge requires customer validation, market response, iteration based on user behavior
- **In engineering**: Knowledge requires working systems, scalability, maintainability, production reliability
- **In traditional crafts**: Knowledge requires apprenticeship, demonstrated mastery, community recognition

These aren't different *levels* of validity (with science being "real" knowledge and everything else being inferior). They're different *types* of knowledge, constructed within different communities for different purposes.

**Important nuance**: Social constructivism doesn't mean "truth is whatever people agree on" or "all beliefs are equally valid." It means that:
1. Knowledge requires social validation (the "justification" in [justified true belief](/glossary/justified-true-belief))
2. Different communities have different, legitimate criteria for justification
3. What counts as evidence varies by context and purpose

## Context from Conversation

Social constructivism was invoked to challenge gatekeeping statements like "marketing isn't science" or "only academic research produces valid knowledge."

**The argument**:
- Academia constructs knowledge through one set of practices (hypothesis testing, peer review, etc.)
- Marketing constructs knowledge through different practices (A/B testing, customer interviews, market response)
- Engineering constructs knowledge through yet different practices (does it work, can we maintain it, does it scale)

None of these is "more valid" in an absolute sense. They're different [paradigms](/glossary/paradigm-shift) suited to different questions and contexts.

**Real-world implication**: When someone says "that's not scientific, therefore it's not valid knowledge," they're making a category error. They're assuming the scientific paradigm is the only legitimate framework for constructing knowledge. But a startup founder who learns that customers hate Feature X through direct market feedback has genuine knowledge - just not knowledge constructed through academic scientific methods.

## The Berger & Luckmann Framework

Sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann described how social construction works:

1. **Externalization**: Humans create social structures, practices, and institutions
2. **Objectivation**: These structures become "real" and external to any individual
3. **Internalization**: New members learn the structures as objective reality

Applied to knowledge: communities develop practices for what counts as valid knowledge, these practices become institutionalized, and new members internalize them as "how knowledge works."

## Implications for Knowledge Management

1. **Multiple valid frameworks**: Don't assume one model (academic, engineering, business) should dominate
2. **Community-specific practices**: What works in one [epistemic community](/glossary/epistemic-communities) may not work in another
3. **Tacit dimensions**: Much of what makes knowledge "valid" in a community is [tacit](/glossary/tacit-knowledge) - you learn it by participating, not by reading rules

## Not Anything Goes

Social constructivism is often misunderstood as relativism ("anything goes if a community believes it"). But:

- **Constraints matter**: All communities test their knowledge against reality in some way
- **Some constructions work better**: Engineering knowledge that leads to stable systems is better than engineering knowledge that leads to constant crashes
- **Cross-community dialogue**: We can compare and critique different knowledge frameworks

The point isn't that all knowledge claims are equally good, but that validity is assessed within frameworks, not from some view from nowhere.
