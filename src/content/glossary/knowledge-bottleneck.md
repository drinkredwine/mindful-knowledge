# Knowledge Bottleneck (Human Attention)

AI generates any amount of tokens. Texts, code, not good or bad - we test and eval. The limit is always human. You must evaluate, decide what matters, provide direction, notice what's wrong. Your attention is finite.

## The Shift in Constraints

### Old Knowledge Work Bottleneck

**Creation** was the bottleneck:
- Writing documentation takes time
- Creating training materials requires effort
- Producing code is labor-intensive
- Generating options requires expertise

Solution: hire more people, work more hours, develop better processes.

### New Knowledge Work Bottleneck

**Evaluation** is the bottleneck:
- AI generates text instantly
- AI produces code variations effortlessly
- AI creates unlimited options and alternatives
- AI synthesizes information at scale

But: Is it right? Is it what we need? Does it solve the actual problem? Is there a subtle error? Does it align with our constraints?

Only you can answer these questions.

## What This Means

### Your Attention Is the Scarce Resource

You have:
- Limited time to review outputs
- Limited cognitive capacity to evaluate quality
- Limited attention to notice errors
- Limited bandwidth to provide feedback
- Limited patience to iterate

AI has:
- Unlimited generation capacity
- Unlimited variation production
- Unlimited patience for iteration
- Unlimited availability

The constraint has flipped from "how do we create enough?" to "how do we evaluate what's created?"

### You Can't Abdicate Judgment

AI provides options. You decide.

AI generates code. You determine if it's correct.

AI suggests approaches. You evaluate fit.

AI synthesizes information. You verify accuracy.

This is not a limitation - it's the definition of the work. Knowledge work is increasingly about:
- Judgment over execution
- Evaluation over creation
- Direction over implementation
- Noticing over producing

## In Practice

### Code Generation

AI writes a function. Instantly. Perfect syntax.

But:
- Does it handle edge cases?
- Is it the right abstraction?
- Does it fit the system architecture?
- Will it create technical debt?
- Is there a subtle security issue?

You must evaluate. This takes time, attention, and expertise. This is the bottleneck.

### Content Production

AI generates a report. Comprehensive. Well-formatted.

But:
- Is the analysis correct?
- Are the conclusions valid?
- Does it match organizational context?
- Is the tone appropriate?
- Are there factual errors?

You must review. Your attention determines quality.

### Decision Support

AI provides five options with analysis of each.

But:
- Which aligns with strategic direction?
- Which is feasible given constraints?
- What are the real trade-offs?
- What's missing from the analysis?
- What actually matters here?

You must decide. AI cannot know what you value most.

## Why Human Attention Matters

### Context

You know:
- Organizational culture and politics
- Unstated constraints
- Historical context
- What's actually valued vs. what's claimed
- Who the stakeholders are and what they care about

AI knows what you tell it. The more context you provide, the better it performs. But providing context takes your attention.

### Judgment

Some decisions require:
- Ethical evaluation
- Understanding nuance
- Balancing competing values
- Taking responsibility for outcomes
- Knowing what's "good enough"

These are human capabilities. AI can inform judgment but not replace it.

### Noticing

You must notice:
- When something feels off
- When assumptions are wrong
- When an answer is plausible but incorrect
- When context is missing
- When the question itself is wrong

Pattern matching and intuition are still human strengths.

### Direction

AI optimizes for what you ask. But:
- Are you asking the right question?
- Should you pivot to a different approach?
- When should you stop iterating?
- What actually needs to be solved?

Setting direction requires understanding what matters. That's your job.

## The Implications

### You Can't Review Everything

If AI can generate unlimited content and code, you cannot review it all. This means:

**Selective Attention**: Choose carefully what to generate. Don't generate "just in case."

**Trust but Verify**: Use techniques that make errors obvious without requiring detailed review.

**Automated Testing**: Let automated systems catch what human attention cannot scale to.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Review summaries first, dive deep only when necessary.

### Quality Control Becomes Critical

When creation is cheap, quality control becomes expensive (in attention terms).

You need:
- Clear criteria for "good enough"
- Fast feedback loops
- Ways to detect errors quickly
- Understanding of failure modes
- Judgment about acceptable risk

### Expertise Still Matters

You need expertise to:
- Evaluate whether output is correct
- Notice subtle errors
- Understand implications
- Judge fit for purpose
- Provide useful feedback

More AI doesn't mean less expertise needed. It means expertise shifts from execution to evaluation.

## Connection to CEO Epistemology

CEOs move up and down abstraction layers:
- High level: strategic direction
- Mid level: evaluating options
- Detail level: noticing specific problems

This movement is the skill. With AI as partner:

**AI handles**: generating options at each layer

**You handle**: deciding what layer needs attention now, evaluating fit, providing direction, noticing misalignment

Your attention determines where to focus. AI amplifies your capacity but doesn't replace your judgment about what matters.

## Working With the Bottleneck

### Be Selective

Don't ask AI to generate everything possible. Ask for what you'll actually evaluate.

### Iterate Quickly

Small iterations with fast feedback are more effective than big generations with slow review.

### Build Evaluation Shortcuts

Create ways to quickly assess quality:
- Tests that reveal problems
- Patterns that signal errors
- Heuristics for "good enough"
- Automated checks where possible

### Accept Imperfection

You cannot catch every error. Optimize for:
- Catching critical errors
- Enabling quick correction
- Failing safely
- Learning from mistakes

### Leverage Your Scarcity

Your attention is scarce. Use it where it matters most:
- Strategic decisions
- Quality evaluation
- Direction setting
- Noticing problems
- Building context

Let AI handle:
- Generation
- Variation
- Synthesis
- Routine implementation
- Formatting and structure

## The Paradox

More AI capability means:
- More output to evaluate
- More options to consider
- More variations to test
- More information to synthesize

Which means:
- Greater demands on your attention
- Higher value on good judgment
- More importance of knowing what matters
- Increased need for clear direction

AI doesn't reduce the importance of human expertise. It shifts where that expertise applies: from creation to evaluation, from execution to judgment, from doing to deciding.

Your attention is the bottleneck. That's not a bug - it's the feature that keeps you essential.
