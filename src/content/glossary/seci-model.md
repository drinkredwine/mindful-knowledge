The SECI Model (Socialization → Externalization → Combination → Internalization) is Ikujiro Nonaka's influential framework for organizational knowledge creation. It proposes a spiral of knowledge conversion between tacit and explicit forms.

## The Critique

"I hate SECI model... It's a consultant's fantasy. Nonaka misunderstood Polanyi—tacit knowledge is UNSPEAKABLE not just unspoken. Externalization is mostly theater."

The fundamental problem: Nonaka treats tacit knowledge as something temporarily unspoken that can be articulated with the right process. But Polanyi's original insight was that some knowledge is structurally impossible to fully articulate—it's tied to our bodies, our contexts, our ways of being in the world.

## The Externalization Fantasy

The SECI model's "externalization" phase assumes tacit knowledge can be converted to explicit knowledge through dialogue, metaphor, and reflection. This creates the illusion that with the right facilitation techniques, all organizational knowledge can be captured and shared.

In practice, what gets externalized is often simplified, context-stripped knowledge that loses the nuance and embodied understanding of the original knower. The model encourages expensive knowledge management theater without creating genuine learning.

## What Gets Lost

The model misses that tacit and explicit knowledge aren't convertible states—they're different kinds of knowing. Writing down how an expert solves problems doesn't transfer their expertise. It creates new explicit knowledge about expertise, which is not the same thing.
