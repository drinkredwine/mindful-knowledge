# Justified True Belief

The classical philosophical definition of knowledge, originating with Plato: Knowledge is not just believing something, or even believing something that happens to be true. Knowledge requires three components: **belief** + **truth** + **justification**.

## Core Concept

For something to count as knowledge (rather than mere opinion or lucky guessing), you need:

1. **Belief**: You must actually believe the proposition
2. **Truth**: The proposition must actually be true
3. **Justification**: You must have good reasons for believing it

**Example**: Imagine you believe it will rain tomorrow because you flipped a coin and it came up heads. Even if it does rain, you don't *know* it will rain - you just made a lucky guess. You have belief and truth, but no justification.

**Contrast**: If you believe it will rain because you checked meteorological data, understand weather patterns, and saw strong indicators, and it does rain - that's knowledge. You have all three components.

## Context from Conversation

This definition was used to expose a critical problem in "knowledge management": What exactly are we managing?

If knowledge requires justification and belief (not just truth), then a document in a wiki isn't knowledge - it's just information. Knowledge lives in people's heads. It involves understanding *why* something is true, not just that it is true.

This challenges the entire premise of traditional KM systems that treat knowledge as an object that can be extracted from people and stored in databases. You can store information, but knowledge? That's far more elusive.

## The Gettier Problem

In 1963, philosopher Edmund Gettier showed that even justified true belief might not be sufficient for knowledge in all cases. But for practical knowledge management purposes, the more fundamental issue remains: most KM systems don't even achieve information that meets the justification criterion, let alone deal with the complexities Gettier raised.
