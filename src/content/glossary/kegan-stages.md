Robert Kegan's theory of adult development describes how our meaning-making evolves through stages. Unlike Piaget's child development stages, Kegan focuses on how adults continue to develop more complex ways of understanding themselves and the world.

## The Three Key Stages (for Adults)

### Socialized Mind
"What shall I do to be accepted?"

Your identity is shaped by your relationships and social context. You understand yourself through others' eyes. Authority and social norms define what's right. You need external validation.

### Self-Authoring Mind
"I know the best move—chessmaster"

You develop your own internal compass. You can step back from social expectations and create your own values and standards. You become the author of your life rather than following a script written by others.

You can evaluate different perspectives and make your own judgments. You're less dependent on external validation.

### Self-Transforming Mind
"Taking freely from various paradigms"

You can hold multiple frameworks simultaneously without needing one to be exclusively right. You see that your self-authored system is itself one perspective among many. You can work across different paradigms, taking what's useful from each.

You recognize all frameworks (including your own) as partial and constructed. This isn't relativism—you can still act and judge—but you hold your positions more lightly.

## The Teaching Challenge

"Now I'm 43yo → transformative mind. Shall I push students to think like 40yo in their early 20s? How to open minds?"

Development can't be forced. You can't make someone jump stages by explaining the next level. They'll interpret your teaching through their current stage.

But you can:
- Create experiences that stretch their current meaning-making
- Model more complex thinking without demanding they match it
- Support the discomfort of outgrowing old frameworks
- Trust the developmental process

## For Knowledge Management

These stages have profound implications for how people relate to knowledge:

**Socialized**: Knowledge is what authorities say, what the field accepts

**Self-Authoring**: Knowledge is what I've critically evaluated and integrated into my framework

**Self-Transforming**: Knowledge is provisional, contextual, emerging from dialogue between paradigms

Traditional KM often assumes self-authoring (individuals creating and sharing knowledge). But much organizational behavior is socialized (following best practices because that's what's done). And cutting-edge thinking might be self-transforming (holding multiple epistemologies simultaneously).

## Development as Knowledge Work

Perhaps knowledge management should focus less on capturing knowledge and more on supporting developmental environments where people can grow in their capacity to make meaning, think critically, and hold complexity.

The stage you're operating from shapes what counts as knowledge and how you relate to learning.
