# Cartesian Doubt

A method of systematic skepticism developed by René Descartes in which you doubt everything that can possibly be doubted in order to find what (if anything) you can know with absolute certainty. Famous for leading to his conclusion: "*Cogito ergo sum*" - "I think, therefore I am."

## Core Concept

Descartes' thought experiment goes like this:

1. **Doubt your senses**: Maybe you're dreaming right now. How do you know you're not?
2. **Doubt even mathematics**: Maybe an evil demon is deceiving you about everything, even basic logic
3. **Find the unshakable foundation**: The one thing you cannot doubt is that *you are doubting*. To doubt, you must exist. "I think, therefore I am."

**The radical conclusion**: Almost nothing is 100% certain. Even things that seem obvious could theoretically be wrong. Only the fact of your own existence as a thinking being is beyond doubt.

## Context from Conversation

In the epistemology discussion, Cartesian doubt was presented not as a source of anxiety, but as **liberation**. Here's why:

If nothing is 100% certain (except your existence as a thinking being), then:
- You don't need to wait for absolute proof before acting
- You don't need gurus or authorities to tell you what's true
- You can trust your own judgment and update your beliefs as you learn
- Being wrong doesn't mean you're a failure - it's just part of how knowledge works

**The key insight**: "Everything can be doubted → nothing is 100% certain → this is *freedom*, not anxiety."

This connects to the paper-flipping exercise in the talk: when you guess what's on the other side of the paper and turn out to be wrong, there's no stress. You just update your belief. That's all learning is - belief updating based on evidence, not the anxious pursuit of absolute certainty.

## Modern Applications

Cartesian doubt is foundational to:
- **Scientific method**: Always question, always test, never assume certainty
- **Critical thinking**: Examine your assumptions before building arguments on them
- **Knowledge work**: Recognize that your mental models are provisional, not absolute truth
