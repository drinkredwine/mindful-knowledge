# Epistemology

Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge itself: What is knowledge? How do we acquire it? What can we actually know? The word comes from the Greek *episteme* (knowledge) and *logos* (study).

## Core Concept

At its heart, epistemology asks questions that sound simple but turn out to be surprisingly complex:

- **What counts as knowledge?** Is it just having information, or something more?
- **How do we know what we know?** Through observation? Reason? Authority? Experience?
- **What are the limits of knowledge?** Are there things we simply cannot know?

These aren't just abstract philosophical puzzles. They have real implications for how we approach learning, expertise, and yes, knowledge management.

## Context from Conversation

The epistemology talk began with a deliberate choice: before diving into knowledge management tools and systems, we need to question our assumptions about knowledge itself. What exactly are we trying to "manage" when we talk about "knowledge management"?

This philosophical grounding revealed something crucial: much of what organizations call "knowledge management" is actually *information* management. True knowledge, as philosophers have understood for millennia, involves belief, justification, understanding, and often cannot be fully articulated or transferred.

By starting with epistemology, we avoid the trap of treating knowledge as just another resource to be captured, stored, and retrieved like files in a database.
