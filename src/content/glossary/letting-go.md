Letting go is the practice of not clinging to thoughts, outcomes, beliefs, or identities. Holding lightly instead of grasping tightly.

## Applied to Knowledge

"Letting go—applies to knowledge too. Not 'know everything.' Know few things very well. Work with recent knowledge, not stale docs. But remember the path."

In knowledge work, we often cling:

**To being right**: "I know this is the right approach"

**To expertise**: "I'm the expert on X" (so I can't admit I don't know)

**To old models**: "This framework worked before" (so I'll force it to fit now)

**To completeness**: "I need to know everything before I can act"

Letting go means loosening these grips.

## Know Less, Better

Instead of trying to know everything, let go of most of it:

- Focus on few things, know them deeply
- Work with recent, relevant knowledge
- Don't cling to stale documentation
- Update as you learn, don't defend old beliefs

The path matters—how you learned, what you tried, why you changed direction. But the specific conclusions? Hold those lightly. They'll evolve.

## Not Knowing as Freedom

When you let go of needing to know:

- Easier to admit "I don't know"
- Easier to change your mind
- Easier to learn from anyone
- Easier to stay curious
- Easier to accept that knowledge evolves

## The Paradox

By letting go of grasping for knowledge, you become a better learner. By holding beliefs loosely, you can update them more readily. By not clinging to expertise, you can keep learning.

The tighter you grip, the more brittle your understanding. The lighter you hold, the more adaptive you become.

## Practice

Notice when you're clinging:
- Defending a position instead of exploring
- Holding onto outdated knowledge
- Needing to be the expert
- Fearing being wrong

Try instead:
- "That's what I thought, but maybe..."
- "I learned this before, but I should check if it's still current"
- "I don't need to know everything"
- "Being wrong means I get to update and learn"

Let it go. Keep learning.
