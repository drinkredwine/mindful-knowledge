Jon Kabat-Zinn identified seven foundational attitudes that support mindfulness practice:

1. **Non-Judging**: Observing without evaluating as good/bad
2. **Patience**: Letting things unfold in their own time
3. **Beginner's Mind**: Seeing with fresh eyes, as if for the first time
4. **Trust**: Trusting yourself and your experience
5. **Non-Striving**: Not forcing outcomes
6. **Acceptance**: Seeing things as they actually are
7. **Letting Go**: Not clinging to thoughts, outcomes, beliefs

## Ancient Wisdom, Modern Frame

These attitudes come from Buddhist meditation traditions that are 2,500 years old. For millennia, they were taught as spiritual practices. No papers in Nature. No randomized controlled trials.

Then Kabat-Zinn brought them to Western medicine in the 1970s, reframed them in secular language, studied them scientifically, and suddenly they became "valid" knowledge in institutional contexts.

The knowledge didn't change. The epistemological framing did.

## Why It Matters for Knowledge Work

These attitudes aren't just for meditation. They're profound epistemological stances:

**Non-Judging**: Stay open to ideas that don't fit your frameworks

**Beginner's Mind**: Expertise can blind you to what's actually there

**Letting Go**: Knowledge evolves; don't cling to old models

**Trust**: Your experience and intuition are valid data

## The Irony

Knowledge management often treats ancient wisdom as "anecdotal" while privileging recent academic research. But these attitudes have survived and spread for thousands of years because they work for human learning and knowing.

Perhaps we should be more mindful about what we dismiss as "not rigorous."
